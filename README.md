# µKanren experiments
This repo contains my experimentation with [µKanren](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf). Thanks [Nate](https://github.com/ncatelli), for the introduction.


## kanren.py
Based on a [papers we love video](https://youtu.be/Dm7_DiNxFNk), where Nicola Mometto walks through a µKanren implementation in Python.

Made some small modification to the code, and added type annotations.

At the end of the file some [test cases from an other implementation](https://github.com/pythological/kanren/blob/main/tests/test_facts.py) are reproduced.
